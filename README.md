## What Is This?

This is a C# project I completed while attending Epicoodus. It's an ASP.NET Core MVC web application that keeps track of a baker's vendors and vendor orders.

## How To Run This Project

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open your shell (e.g., Terminal or GitBash) and navigate to this project's production directory called "PierresBakery".
3. Run `dotnet watch run` in the command line to start the project in development mode with a watcher.
4. Open the browser to _https://localhost:5001_. If you cannot access localhost:5001 it is likely because you have not configured a .NET developer security certificate for HTTPS.
